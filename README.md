# Bloom Core Contracts

This repo houses the core contracts developed for the Bloom protocol. This README outlines the happy paths of the protocol as a method of explaining the role of each contract and how they are used.

## Prerequisites

These contracts assume that the [Bloom token sale](https://github.com/hellobloom/crowdsale) is over and people can freely transfer BLT (our ERC20 token) to each other.
